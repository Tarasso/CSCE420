# Proj2

My project can be compiled using `make` and ran using either of these commands:
* `$make run FILE="<filename>"`
* `$./BlocksworldAstar <filename>`

You can optionally run the python script `stats.py` using `$python3 stats.py` to automatically run the complied `BlocksworkAstar` program on all 45 of the given test cases. The statistics will be outputted to `STATISTICS.txt`

This has been developed and tested on compute.cs.tamu.edu servers with `MAX_ITERS` set to 100000
