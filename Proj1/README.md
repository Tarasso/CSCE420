# Proj1

My project can be compiled using `make` and ran using either of these commands:
* `make run FILE="<filename>"`
* `./BlocksworldBFS <filename>`

Based on my testing of running my program on the compute.cs.tamu.edu servers, it seems to work through iterations quite quickly so `MAX_ITERS` is currently set to 5 million before it gives up solving a given problem.
